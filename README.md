# A Corpus of Because X

The list of IDs you find in this repository is based on the article by Martin Konvička and Kristin Stöcker with the title '(Non-)Ellipses in Dutch, English, and German: The case of because X'.


The tweets collected in November 2019 show the because X construction in the three aforementioned languages. For ethical and privacy reasons we are not allowed to publish a list of tweets in plain text. 
For information about how to retrieve (hydrate) plain text tweets including metadata I refer to the [*twarc* documentation.](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc)

Note that this corpus is free to use for the purpose of any academic research. If you do use it please make sure to cite it:
